A Recipe for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus.

The WSJ corpus consists of about 80 hours of read sentences taken from the Wall Street Journal. The WSJ corpus can be purchased from the LDC as LDC93S6B (wsj0) and LDC94S13B (wsj1).

In these experiments, we use three subsets following the [Kaldi WSJ recipe](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/blob/master/egs/wsj/):

train: 37416 utterances, referred to as si284 in Kaldi
dev: 503 utterances, referred to as nov93dev in Kaldi
test: 333 utterances, referred to as nov92 in Kaldi
